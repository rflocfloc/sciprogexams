### Exercise 2 [SECOND MODULE, theory]

Given a sorted list L of n elements, please compute the asymptotic computational
complexity of the following fun function, explaining your reasoning.

```python
def fun(L):
	if len(L)== 1:
		return L[0]
	return max(L[0],fun(L[1:]))
```
Remember that the slicing operator creates a new list to store the sliced elements.

### Exercise 3 [FIRST MODULE/SECOND MODULE, lab/theory]

Implement the ```sort()``` method of the class *PancakeSort* in the file [exercise3.py]([/exams/2023_12_19/qcb/exercise3.py](https://github.com/rflocfloc/sciprogexams/blob/main/exams/2023_12_19/qcb/exercise3.py)) . To test the
implementation, execute the file [exercise3.py](/exams/2023_12_19/qcb/exercise3.py), which is already equipped with a main
code that tests the method by sorting the list [7, 5, 10, -11, 3, -4, 99, 1].
Imagine you have a stack of pancakes of different sizes, and you want to arrange them in
order from the largest at the bottom to the smallest at the top. Here's how Pancake Sort
works:
Start with your stack of unsorted pancakes. The stack represents the list of numbers that
you want to sort (it is not an actual stack data structure).
	
1. Iterate over the stack of pancakes (list of numbers) starting from the bottom
pancake (end of the list) and going towards the top (first pancake). This because
at the end of each iteration the biggest pancake (number) will be moved to the
bottom of the stack (last position in the list), and we want to reduce the size of the list we work with at each iteration.
2. At each iteration, identify the biggest pancake ( number ) and get its position X.
3. If the biggest pancake is not already at the top, flip the unsorted stack to move it
there (in the first position of the list). This means that you must flip the sub-list that
goes from 0 to position X.
4. Now, flip the entire stack (list) so that the biggest pancake is now at the bottom
(end of the list).
5. Repeat the process, focusing on a smaller stack each time (excluding the pancake
you've already sorted, which is now at the end).
6. Continue until all pancakes are in order (i.e. when you reach the first position in the
list)
Keep in mind that with flip we mean to reverse the order of the elements in the list (or
sub-list). Below there is an example of how the sorting works:
